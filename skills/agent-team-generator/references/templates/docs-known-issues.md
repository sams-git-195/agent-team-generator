# {{project.name}} — Known Issues

Minor issues found in review and accepted for now. Each has a fix prompt: paste it to the
owning agent to fix it. **When an entry is fixed, delete it** in the same commit — this file
lists what is open; git history holds what was closed. Anything serious does not belong here;
it blocks the merge instead. Anything nobody can hit does not belong here either: an entry is
added only if it passes the 🟣 gate (protocol §5: who it reaches, seen or unseen, can it
actually happen). Check an issue is not already listed before adding it; number on from the
last ID.

*(no open issues)*
